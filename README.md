# Image_Video_Analysis

This repository hosts the lab exercices in the course of Image - Video Analysis and Technology (8th semester, ECE - NTUA). 

 - First exercice deals with Laplacian and Gaussian Pyramids as a method of image compression. 
 
 - In the second exercice, we study and trains specific CNN architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG) based on which we design our own CNN architecture (myCNN) that tackles the problem of image detection and object classification for CIFAR100 dataset.

 - In the third exercice, we implement YOLOv3 algorithm for object detection and tracking in a video. We also determine the effect of hyperparameters `nms_thres` and `conf_thres` on the accuracy of the bounding boxes produced by YOLOv3.

 All the exercices include crucial conclusions and observations which are extensively showcased through various graphs.
